_At ten years of age, Tito was caught playing his father's guitar after he broke a string. After fixing the string, Joe demanded that he play for him. Once he was finished, Joe bought him his own guitar, and convinced Tito, Jackie, and Jermaine to form a singing group. He was impressed with the vocals of Jackie and Jermaine._

Tito picks up the guitar and STRUMS! He’s a musician! The dusty room comes alive as he plays some SOUL CHORDS and LICKS. Lost in the groove, he BREAKS THE E STRING.

I don’t know about this one. I had just read that paragraph on Tito Jackson’s Wikipedia page, found it funny for reasons I couldn't articulate, and thought to myself, maybe it's because the way this is written, it would be very strange to translate it literally to the silver screen, so let’s go ahead and do that
