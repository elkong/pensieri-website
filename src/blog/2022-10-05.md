<span class="small-caps">When British people are worked up</span> about something, they don’t have a furor. Oh, no. Perish the thought! They go and have a _furore_.

(I’m highly amused by _furore_ as a word. One would think, by such examples as _color/colour_ and _flavor/flavour_ that the British spelling of _furor_ might be _furour_, but oho, British English is way too crafty for that! _Furore_ it is.)

And I know it’s a mere quirk of orthography, but please indulge me—I like to think of _furores_ (stress on the second syllable) as Very British furors. Nixon’s involvement in a breach of the DNC headquarters in 1972 caused a furor, but King Edward VIII’s whirlwind romance with an American divorcée in 1936 caused a _furore_. In my imagination, any old widespread unrest can be a furor, but a _furore_ is not complete without tea-bags and British accents and tiny Union Jack flags.

Sorry. I will show myself out now.
