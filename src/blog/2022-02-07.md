EXT. PARK - DAY
</li>

<li class="action">
A small suburban park on a Sunday afternoon. Children on swings and play-structures, teenagers skating the perimeter, parents surveying. Two old-timers, MELVIN and DOROTHY, lounge on a park bench, Melvin nodding off on Dorothy’s shoulder.

MASKED WOLF and his ACCOMPLICE, 6 foot 4 and clad in black leather jackets, enter the park. The Accomplice bears a BOOM-BOX in one hand and an AXE in the other.

Nervous looks from the park patrons. They’re not from around here. A few bystanders begin recording the scene on cell phones.

<li class="action">
Masked Wolf plants himself firmly on a spot three feet in front of the Old-Timers and turns to face them. He crouches to meet Dorothy’s eyes. As the music crescendos, the Accomplice sets down the boom-box and RAISES THE AXE ABOVE HIS HEAD WITH BOTH HANDS.

The music drops out.
