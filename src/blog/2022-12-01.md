<span class="small-caps">Lyrics, set to the tune of</span> _O Canada_:

<br />

Empanada!

Our tasty pastry friend!

Unto our mouths

With pride we thee commend!

From far and wide

Whether baked or fried

With beef or pork or cheese

Empanada,

Empanada,

Thy golden folds do please.

Thy flaky crust

Fills us with glee!

Empanada,

We fill our mouths with thee.

Empanada,

We fill our mouths with thee.

Of course, this one only works if you pronounce "Empanada" as if it rhymes with "Canada", which, to me, is what makes it funny
