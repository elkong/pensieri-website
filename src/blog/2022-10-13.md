<div class="play-sceneheader">Scene One.</div>

<br />

<div class="play-setting">
Empty classroom. Day.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
Two adults, CHARLIE and CLEMENT, stand at opposite sides of the classroom, desks pushed off to the side. They’re very timid. CHARLIE holds a sheet of paper in his hand.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-parenthetical">
reading off the paper
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Step two. Make eye contact with the other person.
</div>
<div class="play-parenthetical">
He looks up at CLEMENT.
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
I guess I have to make eye contact with you.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CLEMENT
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
How do we do that?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
I dunno.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
They face each other. This takes visible effort.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
I guess I can...
</div>
<div class="play-action">
He takes a step forward. And another step.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
CLEMENT, in turn, takes steps toward CHARLIE. Haltingly they approach each other, until after roughly fifteen seconds they are virtually nose to nose.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CLEMENT
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Um, so how are we gonna do the eye contact?
</div>
<div class="play-action">
He moves in closer. Their noses linger on each other.
</div>
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Okay this isn’t gonna work.
</div>
<div class="play-action">
They ponder, the tips of their noses still in tactile congress. CLEMENT’s breath fogs up CHARLIE’s rosy cheeks.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
How about I, uh, rotate myself a hundred and eighty? Then it will be, like, my right eye touches your left eye, and my left eye touches your right eye. Or wait, my right eye touches your right eye, and my left eye touches your left eye.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CLEMENT
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Yeah, let’s try that.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
CHARLIE brings a desk into the centre of the room and tries to contort himself so that his face is upside down. It’s no use. Lying balanced atop the desk, with CLEMENT kneeling, CHARLIE manages about 120 degrees of rotation.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Hey, how about you also use a desk? We both turn ninety, but in opposite directions, so we’re upside down relative to each other.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
They do that. After a minute of fidgeting they manage to situate themselves, both precariously balanced on different desks, for contact. Unceremoniously CHARLIE rotates, until they bump. Their eyelids do not come into contact, although their eyebrows do flirt within a centimetre of each other.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CLEMENT
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Sorry I guess my forehead’s too large.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Yeah.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CLEMENT
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Any other ideas?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
No. I guess we just mention this to Miss Morales in the report.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
They leave the room.

Blackout.
