<span class="small-caps">To-day at the gas station</span> there was this horrible man. He was lumbering all around the station, wandering among the cars and the gas pumps, pushing along a bicycle and a large trash-bag sack, and all the while shouting. He shouted things about Trump and Biden and used the word fuckin a lot. He shouted things about various ethnicities and robots and AI taking your jobs. He shouted at nobody in particular, approaching and receding, but I got the feeling that if I gave the slightest twitch of a reaction he would direct all of his attention at me. Everyone else at the pumps was also trying her best to ignore him completely.

I had two thoughts.

The sensible part of me thought, _I need to get out of here as quickly as possible_.

The writer part of me thought, _Maybe I ought to listen and gather material_.

The sensible part of me prevailed, and as soon as the fuel nozzle clicked, I grabbed my receipt and got back into my car. I exchanged a glance and a shrug with the woman who was using the gas pump opposite me before we both hightailed it out of there into safer streets.

The writer part of me thinks, _This Kitten Carnival entry could have been a lot stronger if only I stayed around to take down the monologue_.
