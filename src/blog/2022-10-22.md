<div style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">An Audio Play</div>

<br />

<div class="play-sceneheader">Dramatis personae</div>

<br />

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span>, male, 5. Wide-eyed, innocent, full of energy.

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span>, female, 30s. Worn down by life in general.

<br />

<div class="play-sceneheader">Act I</div>

<br />

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; Mom!

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; _(in the distance)_ &nbsp; What?

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; Mom, look at!

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; Look at what?

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; A man! I think he’s pooping!

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; Timmy! Don’t look at him.

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; But Mom!

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; _(exasperated)_ &nbsp;What?

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; I think he’s having trouble pooping!

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; Timmy, that’s none of your business. Now come along.

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; I can help him.

_<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> moves closer to the microphone._

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; Hey pooping man! Are you having trouble pooping?

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; _(rushing over)_ &nbsp; Timmy, no, get away from there! Give the man his privacy!

<span class="small-caps">Timmy</span> &nbsp; You can do it! I believe in you, pooping man!

_<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> yanks away <span class="small-caps">Timmy</span>, who squeals and starts crying._

<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> &nbsp; Timmy, you are in very big trouble, you hear me? &nbsp; _(to the microphone)_ &nbsp; I’m very sorry, sir, my son doesn’t know how to behave himself in public. &nbsp; _(to Timmy)_ &nbsp; Let’s go.

_<span class="small-caps">Mom</span> pulls <span class="small-caps">Timmy</span>, still kicking and screaming, into the distance as inoffensive ambient music takes over._

<br />

<div class="play-sceneheader">Act II</div>

<br />

_26 more hours of inoffensive ambient music._
