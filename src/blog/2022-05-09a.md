<span class="small-caps">Reports have surfaced</span> that pop star Ed Sheeran began to hover and drift eastward at precisely 9:05 p.m. London time. The singer-songwriter was performing at a private club in London when, as patrons report, he abruptly assumed a prayer pose, letting his guitar fall out of his hands, and began to hover two feet in the air. A faint glow surrounded him as he began to drift eastward at a steady unbroken velocity, through the walls of the club and across the Thames. In this state, the “Bad Habits” star is entirely unresponsive as he glides incorporeal over the streets of East London. Sarah Crowley-Smith, a student at the London School of Economics, reports that Sheeran “appeared out of a pub wall and passed through [her] like a ghost on the corner,” additionally noting that “he left a distinct trace of musk.”
