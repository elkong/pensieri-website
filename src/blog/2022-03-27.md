<span class="small-caps">Swapping the genders</span> of pronouns in song lyrics is so boring now. You know what I’d love to see? The persons swapped. Like, first person vs. second person. Why is it always “I” who is doing the loving, and “you” being the one who gets loved? Let’s hear some lyrics like these:

<br />

<i>

I am your sunshine, your only sunshine / I make you happy when skies are grey

I make you / Feel like you’re living a teenage dream / The way I turn you on

I am the promised kiss of springtime / That makes the lonely winter seem long

You’re getting sentimental over me

You’re my biggest fan / You’ll follow me until I love you

Baby you need my loving

You got your driver’s licence last week / Just like we always talked about

You can’t tell why you love me, but you do, do, do

You don’t want to set the world on fire / You just want to start a flame in my heart

Every bond I break / Every step I take / You’ll be watching me

You love me, always forever / Near and far, closer together

I make you feel so young

You love me more with every breath truly madly deeply

You’re mine

You were getting used to being someone I loved

I’ve lost that lovin’ feeling

I’m the top

I light up your life

I’m the cream in your coffee / I’m the salt in your stew

That’s what makes me beautiful

You’ll see me in your dreams

Never gonna give me up / never gonna let me down / never gonna run around / and desert me

You wanna be loved by me / Just me, and nobody else but me

I make you feel like a natural woman

You’re in love with the shape of me

Can’t take your eyes off of me

Baby you’d walk a thousand miles / If you could just see me

You’re confessin’ that you love me

Me, your brown-eyed girl

Are the stars out to-night? / You don’t know if they’re cloudy or bright / Cause you only have eyes for me

I make you feel brand new

Never mind you’ll find / Someone like me

You’ll make love to me

You’re so into me, into me, into me

I’m so vain / I probably think this song is about me
