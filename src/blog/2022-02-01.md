In late January, I had resolved to write at least 50 words a day that no one would see, beginning February 1. This is my first entry. What an auspicious beginning! <br />
Also, There is a melody that goes with this, and it does pass through my mind sometimes (with these lyrics), but I have not recorded it yet because I don't have a punk rock voice and also don't know how to play the guitar.
