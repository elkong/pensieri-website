If I up and book it

Shift the gears and slam the gas

Maybe I could get to work in

Time to take that call

<br />

Down the 405

Veering left and swerving right

Make it to my desk and save my job

If I book it

<br />

Clients come and clients go

But here’s the big one, that I know

I gotta land this deal or

My boss will fire me

<br />

If I gun the engines

Rip across the interstate

Save my skin if I book it

<br />

I woke up today

At 9:15

My phone was ringing on the stand

Boss was on the line

Handset shaking in my hand

When he said “Get your ass here pronto”

<br />

Pedal to the metal

Flying sparks and screeching tires

And the cops could slap a ticket

Right on my sorry ass

If I book it

Really floor it

<br />

If I up and book it

Shift the gears and slam the gas

Maybe I could get to work in

Time to take that call

If I book it

I think it’s funnier if you listen to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9Vit2vq22M">original</a> song while reading these lyrics. The exercise here, of course, was to take the saddest song I knew, and write utterly mundane lyrics to it, all while respecting the prosody, rhyme scheme, structure, &c., of the original.
