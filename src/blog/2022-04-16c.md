<span class="small-caps">There is a _lot_ of weirdness</span> that goes on in the world of nicknames, but for to-day I will just focus on three common traditional English male names.

_Robert_ can become _Rob_, but also _Bob_.

_Richard_ can become _Rick_, but also _Dick_.

_William_ can become _Will_, but also _Bill_.

What is it with this shortening, and then transmuting the first letter? I mean, I can understand the shortening, everyone does that, but the consonant swap? Why does _W_ become _B_, and why does _R_ become either _B_ or _D_? Can a _Robert_ become a _Dob_? Can a _Richard_ become a _Bick_?

What of _Bobert_, _Dichard_, and _Billiam_? Were those ever names?
