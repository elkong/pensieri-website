“<span class="small-caps">Hi, InsuriCorp enterprise service desk</span>, how can I help you?”

“Oh shit! Um, hi! Sorry.”

“Sorry?”

“Um, sorry, never mind. I didn’t have a problem.”

“Oh?”

“Okay, maybe I do have a problem, just not a technical one. Sorry about that.”

“I don’t understand, ma’am. Do you have a problem?”

“Um, no. Sorry. I was, uh, actually hoping you wouldn’t pick up.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Okay, you see, the hold music, the music that plays when you guys put me on hold, I don’t know if you get a chance to listen to it, but that shit really bops. I was trying to call at what I thought was a busy time so you’d put me in the queue and I’d get enough time to Shazam it. But then I realised I was calling from the same phone that I had Shazam installed on, so I had to download Shazam on my work phone and then hold it to my personal phone’s speaker and I think it was getting something, but then you picked up, and then Shazam said we could not find anything. Um, sorry. I know I’m wasting your time and you’ve got a lot of people who are actually waiting for legit help. Sorry. I’ll go now.”

“Have a good day.”
