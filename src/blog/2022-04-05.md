<div class="play-sceneheader">Scene One.</div>

<br />

<div class="play-setting">
One-room flat, London. Day.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
JAX JONES, CHARLI XCX, and SAWEETIE are sitting in chairs, silent, as if politely trying not to notice each other. JOEL CORRY bursts through the door.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Hey, sorry I’m late! Thank you all for flying in at short notice.
</div>
<div class="play-action">
JOEL takes a seat.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLI XCX
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
I live here.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
For sure. Okay, do you all know why you’re here?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JAX JONES / SAWEETIE / CHARLI XCX
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Tea? Wimbledon’s on? / We’re holding a séance, right? / I live here.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
No! We’re making a song!
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
SAWEETIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
A song. <i>Right.</i>
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
First order of business. What should a song be called?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
Silence, until it trembles on the brink of awkwardness.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JAX JONES
</div>
<div class="play-parenthetical">
shrugging
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
I Love You Baby?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLI XCX
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Aw, that’s cute.
</div>
<div class="play-action">
CHARLI throws her hands up, grandly.
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
I Love You, Baby!
</div>
<div class="play-action">
CHARLI gives JAX a high-five.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
SAWEETIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Yeah, that hits the spot. Good one, Mister...?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JAX JONES
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Jones. Jax Jones.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Hey guys, that’s nice and all, don’t you think that’s, like, a little overdone by now? Like, anyone can say I Love You Baby, it’s not exactly original if you know what I mean. What’s a title that says: this is us?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
SAWEETIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Teardrops on My Guitar?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JAX JONES
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Hey, where’d you learn to get all fancy like that? That’s some poetic-ass shit—
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
No, we can’t do that, Taylor Swift did that already. Come on.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
SAWEETIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
You’re right, you’re right. I don’t think I even own a guitar, if I’m being honest with you.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Okay guys, we’re getting nowhere. Look, I gotta be at Tony’s by four thirty. Come on now. We’re all musicians. Competent musicians. Some of us even have hits. One good song title and we can call it a day. Guys.
</div>
<div class="play-action">
JOEL gets up and paces the floor, snapping.
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Doesn’t even have to be perfect at first. We can decide later. Just put your brains together, not literally of course, and help me come up with something.
</div>
<div class="play-action">
JOEL waits, as JAX, CHARLI, and SAWEETIE each become oddly enraptured by mildly interesting stains on the ceiling.
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Okay, let’s try this. Don’t even think about it. Give me an idea that speaks from the heart.
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
SAWEETIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Look, Mister, uh, Mister, it’s nice and all you’re giving us the chance to pick the song title, but it’s sorta late and maybe we ain’t—
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLI XCX
</div>
<div class="play-parenthetical">
without warning
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
OUT OUT

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
What?
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
CHARLI XCX
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
OUT OUT
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JAX JONES
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
Joel, that’s it! OUT OUT
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
SAWEETIE
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
No, yeah, that’s perfect! It’s, like, the perfect hook <i>and</i> it says something real about, like, society and shit. It even rhymes with itself! I’m a sucker for dope internal rhymes. You go, girl! OUT OUT
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-character">
JOEL CORRY
</div>
<div class="play-dialogue">
You know, y’all might be onto something here...
</div>

<br />

<div class="play-action">
Blackout.
