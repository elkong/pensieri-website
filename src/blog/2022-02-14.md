Incorrect, because redundant: HIV virus, PIN number, ATM machine.

Correct: HIV, PIN, ATM. Alternatively human immunodeficiency virus, personal identification number, automated teller machine.

Probably correct? even though nobody says things like this: HI virus, PI number, AT machine.

Also probably correct, I guess: human I virus, P identification number, automated teller M.
