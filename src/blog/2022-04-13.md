My ears perked up at the strange word _perq_. It seemed to mean _perk_. Maybe _perk_ came from _perq_?

It turns out that _perq_ is short for _perquisite_, which is not a mistyping of _prerequisite_, but a perfectly legitimate word which means a benefit, a tip, a bonus. Basically, a perk. I can understand the joy of synonyms, yes, but why do we have two synonyms that also sound like each other?

It gets stranger, though. _Grammarist_ says, “**Perk** means lively, pert, though _perky_ is the form most often used for this definition.” Why does _perk_ mean _pert_? Are they two separate words with two separate etymologies, or are they one word that half of everybody says differently? Is this like how some people say _buck naked_ but others say _butt naked_ and nobody knows which one is “correct”?

And I know that’s not the same definition that _perq_ is relevant to, but still one can’t help but notice: _perq_ means _perk_ and _perk_ means _pert_.

English.
