<span class="small-caps">A cheap set of six drinking glasses</span> bought by Kate Lainey from an IKEA on September 4, 2011. Their fates:

One slipped from her fingers onto the hardwood floor while being taken out of the dishwasher. Los Angeles, CA, May 28, 2014.

One hurled by her boyfriend Jed, shattering upon impact with the apartment wall. Irvine, CA, April 5, 2018.

(Four left behind in August 2020 with boyfriend Ben, who gave them to the next tenants when the lease expired in May 2021.)

One elbowed off the table by eight-year-old Sukhil Chatterjee. Stockton, CA, January 11, 2023.

One damaged inside a moving company van. US Route 89 five miles out of Flagstaff, AZ, June 19, 2029.

One dropped by Olivia Janney Porter, bio lab assistant, uncharacteristically intoxicated at a masked dinner party. Toronto, ON, October 31, 2031.

One smashed in an earthquake, a stone column falling on its glass case in the east wing of the Audrey G. Ngo Presidential Museum. Seattle, WA, November 2, 2164.

Sometimes I think about the life-stories that the objects around me must have had. This piece is a meditation on that sort of thing.
