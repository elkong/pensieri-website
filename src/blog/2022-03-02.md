INT. LECTURE HALL - NIGHT
</li>

<li class="action">
Now Alicia is standing at the front of a smallish university lecture hall, commanding the space, the rows intermittently filled with night school students. Plaster peeling from the walls, this place hasn’t been renovated in decades. On stage left is a LARGE WOODEN EASEL, fashioned into a presentation board and manned by her unflappable ASSISTANT (70s).
</li>
<li class="action">
Alicia motions to the Assistant to flip to the next chart, revealing A WOMAN IN FLAMES, which Alicia indicates with her laser pointer.

She motions to the Assistant to flip again. Another woman, dousing her flaming body with a fire extinguisher.

Glossy-eyed students take down desultory notes. The next chart displays a lady photographed escaping from a burning office building, flames licking at her thighs.

<li class="action">
Someone coughs, and the Assistant dutifully flips to the next chart. A new female human, caught in a new conflagration of the big white-orange, luminous in mid-scream.
