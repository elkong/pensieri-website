maybe to you the point of Art is

to gaze upon beauty

to transcend the everyday

to lose yourself in awe of something greater than yourself

to brush the face of eternity

to find yourself transported to strange spaces, foreign lands, bygone eras

to drop your jaw, transfix you in the splendour of sheer technical virtuosity

to affirm the primacy of the human soul

to signal that youâ€™re cool

to build an identity around

to glorify GOD

to recenter the voices of the marginalised and oppressed

to impart good moral character on the youth

to spit at the corporate establishment

to glimpse perfection

to celebrate imperfection

to rally a community, a movement, a party, a people

to profane the sacred

to _feel_ something, anything at all

but to me the point of Art is

to distract people for an hour

while I saw off

the catalytic converters

from under their Priuses

in the museum parking lot
