<span class="small-caps">This must be somewhere in the lesson plans</span> of those _How to Effectively Run a Content Curation Account on Instagram_ courses they hawk at aspiring content curators:

_Whenever you have a clip with something physically exciting happening, cut it off right before the moment of impact. The moment the diver breaks the water surface. The frame where the priceless vase hits the floor. The instant the stunt go-kart, tumbling through a graceless arc, smacks rubber on dirt. Leave the viewer unsatisfied, so that when Instagram instantly loops back to the start of the clip, she will feel compelled to watch the whole thing again. This increases viewing time and view count. The closer you can time your cutoff, the more convinced she will be that maybe she only missed the frame of impact because she blinked at the wrong time, that if she just concentrated hard enough, the frame youâ€™re withholding will appear to her more clearly this time. Depending on the length of your clip you can get a good one or two or three extra views per user out of this trick._
