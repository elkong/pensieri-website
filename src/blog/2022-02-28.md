“<span class="small-caps">You’re listening to 96.5 The Vibe</span>, bringing you the best hits from the Eighties, Nineties, and to-day!”

_Indistinct speech._

“Not now, Emily, we’re on the air.”

_Indistinct speech._

“Bringing you the best hits from the Eighties, Nineties, um, Two Thousands? and to-day!”

_Indistinct speech._

“Bringing you the best hits from the Eighties, Nineties, Two Thousands, Twenty Tens, and to-day!”

_Indistinct speech._

“Whaddaya mean, of course we play songs from the Eighties.”

_Indistinct speech, and a pause._

“You know what? Fine. Bringing you the best hits from the Nineties, Two Thousands, Twenty Tens, and to-day!”

_Indistinct speech, and a loud sigh._

“Bringing you the best hits from the Two Thousands, Twenty Tens, and to-day! Coming up next—”

_Indistinct speech._

“Okay what now? Also get your hands off, that’s my good shirt.”

_Indistinct speech._

“Kid, literally nobody calls it that.”

_Indistinct speech._

“Yes, but no.”

_Indistinct speech._

“Bringing you the best hits from the Twenty Hundreds, Twenty Tens, and to-day? Come on, Em, do you hear how stupid that sounds?”

_Indistinct speech._

“From the Hundreds, Tens, and to-day? Hey look at how many listeners we’re alienating—”

_Indistinct speech._

“I said, stop it with the tugging!”

_Indistinct speech._

“You know what? I’ve fucking had it with you. Get the fuck out of my studio, you annoying little—”

_A loud crash, shouting, fisticuffs, glass breaking, and other alarums and excursions. Silence. Tapping on a microphone._

“Hey, this is your new host, Emily! You’re listening to 96.5 The Vibe, bringing you the best hits from the Twenty-Oh-Four to Twenty-Eleven Period, the Twenty-Sixteen to Twenty-Eighteen Period, March 2020, June to November 2021, and to-day!”
